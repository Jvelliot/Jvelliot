- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jvelliot
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, specifically focusing on front-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
- 💞️ I’m not currently seeking to collaborate on any projects as I am still in the infancy of my training. I look forward to hearing any recommendations on how I can best get started using Github!
- 📫 You can reach me by email at BlvckSvils@gmail.com.
